# Meta Creative Fatigue Alert System

## Problem
In paid marketing, creative fatigue is often detected too late.
By the time CTR drops and CPM increases significantly, a lot of budget is already wasted.

## Objective
To proactively detect creative fatigue in Meta ads and alert the marketing team
before performance drops severely.

## What this tool does
- Monitors Meta ad creatives on a daily basis
- Compares recent performance vs past performance
- Flags creatives showing fatigue signals
- Sends high-priority alerts via Email and WhatsApp

## Fatigue Signals (Initial Version)
A creative is marked as fatigued if:
- CTR drops by 30% or more
- CPM increases by 25% or more
- Frequency is above 2.5
- Minimum spend threshold is met

## Why this matters
- Prevents delayed creative refresh
- Reduces wasted ad spend
- Enables proactive performance optimisation
